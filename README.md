## FREESTYLE MV/OBSERVER-PATTERN
(ðŸ‘½ no warranty for anything!! ðŸ‘½)

I wanted a pattern with observers, where changes can be applied directly on an outer data-object, so the use is all on data as natural as possible after the views once got instantiated.

For now not sure whether I will change the approach to define setters/getters recursively to fit for any kind of object.
And whether to stay with the notification of a single `key:value` instead of entire set of relevant data.

(But I guess I'll implement those changes soon)
